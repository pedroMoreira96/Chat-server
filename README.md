# Serverchat

This is my Java Chat Server repository! This project, was developed during the first weeks of my Full-stack bootcamp. It is a simple chat application built with Java, using PrintWriters, BufferedReaders, and Transmission Control Protocol, allowing multiple clients to connect and communicate in real-time. To enter the chat you need to run "nc localhost 9090" on your terminal.

Controls:

Help - controls
Whisper [username] - private chat
Exit whisper - exit private chat
Block [username] - block user
Unblock [username] - unblock user
Users - list of online users
Exit - exit chat
